<h1>Category Instructions: Service Setter Booked</h1>

<p>The purpose of the category Service Setter Booked is to determine if the caller represents a service
  appointmentopportunity and if an appointment was booked during the call.</p>

<p><strong>Helpful information:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>​Qualified agent: </strong>An employee that is able to assist a caller with his or her inquiry. The
    qualified employee may at times need to call back in order to provide an answer or solution. As
    long as the same employee is the one intending to return the call, it is still considered
    connected.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Unqualified agent</strong>: An employee that is not able to assist the caller with his or her inquiry. A
    caller may reach an unqualified employee and hold a conversation, but it is not considered a
    connected call unless the caller is connected to someone who can assist him or her with their
    inquiry.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Appointment opportunity</strong>: Connected calls about potential maintenance or repair service(s)
    the shop can perform, repair or installation of a part that the shop can perform, or confirmed
    open recalls that the service shop can perform.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Service opportunities include but are not limited to</strong>:

    <ul>
      <li>Oil changes
      </li>
      <li>Fluid flushes
        Key programming / key cutting / key battery replacement</li>
      <li>
        Part installation
      </li>
      <li>Tire installation
      </li>
      <li>Battery installation
      </li>
      <li>Car detailing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>​<strong>Call types that should NOT be considered service</strong>:

    <ul>
      <li>Body work or collision repair
      </li>
      <li>Car washes
      </li>
      <li>Finance, sales, etc<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>​<strong>Interactive systems and auto-attendants</strong>: Calls handled by an interactive system or
    auto-attendant will sound like interactive recordings that ask questions or request information and
    require the caller to interact by making phone selections. <strong>When a call is successfully handled
      by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call</strong>, and
    proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call.
    <strong>When a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of
      successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not
      connected</strong>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reminders:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Calls in this category need to be reviewed based on this category&apos;s instructions. Overview
        instructions for other appointment related categories do not apply to this category. </li>
      <li>The service appointment time should be considered the time the vehicle can be serviced.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Here are the options:</strong></span></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Specific appointment or walk-in time / range within 1 hour</strong><br>

    <ul>
      <li>​Caller agrees to an appointment with a <strong>specific date and time.</strong> <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I need a tune-up.&quot;// Receptionist or agent: &quot;We can fit
            you in at
            11:45 tomorrow morning.&quot;// Caller: &quot;Perfect. I&apos;ll see you then!&quot;// Call
            ends.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong> Caller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time</strong> for the
        appointment. In these instances, the agent’s statement trumps the caller&apos;s.

        <ul>
          <li>Example - Caller: &quot;I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.&quot; // Agent: &quot;I&apos;ll
            put you down for
            3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that&apos;s fine.&quot;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller agrees to an appointment with a <strong>specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle
          off before the scheduled appointment.</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I need an oil change.&quot;// Agent: &quot;I will schedule you for
            10:00 AM
            tomorrow.&quot;// Caller: &quot;Can I drop my car off before my appointment?&quot; // Agent:
            &quot;Yes, you
            can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.&quot;// Caller:
            &quot;Great,
            thanks!&quot; // Call ends.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller agrees to an <strong>approximate time within a 1 hour time range</strong> because they are able
        to be
        serviced at the time of arrival.<br>

        <ul>
          <li>​A walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should
            be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is
            not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the
            service can be completed at that arrival time.
          </li>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings
            today?&quot;// Agent: &quot;You can come in now if you&apos;d like&quot;// Caller: &quot;Great!
            I&apos;ll be there in half an
            hour.&quot; // Call ends.
          </li>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about
            20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?&quot; // Agent: &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s no problem.
            We&apos;ll look at
            it as soon as it arrives.&quot;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller <strong>agrees to an approximate time of &quot;around 1 hour&quot;.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Caller <strong>discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment</strong> during the
        same
        call.

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I&apos;m checking on the status of my car that&apos;s in service,
            and I also
            wanted to know if I could bring my wife&apos;s car in for an oil change.&quot;// Agent:
            &quot;Your car is
            ready to be picked up, we can get your wife&apos;s car in at 4:00 if that time works for
            you.&quot;//
            Caller: &quot;That works. We&apos;ll be there at 4:00.&quot;<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>​​Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour</strong><br>

    <ul>
      <li>​Caller gives a <strong>vague agreement to possibly come in.</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: &quot;Yes,
            we&apos;re
            pretty open all morning.&quot; // Caller: &quot;Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.&quot; //
            Call ends.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I&apos;ll be there in about 2 hours.&quot;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.&quot;&nbsp;</li>
          <li> In this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose
            appointment time.
          </li>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I won&apos;t be able to get there until after 5:00.&quot;
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>In this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Receptionist or <strong>agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served</strong> and the
        caller says
        &quot;OK.&quot;<br>

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;Do I need an appointment for an oil change?&quot;// Receptionist or
            agent: &quot;It is first come, first served.&quot;// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller agrees to be an <strong>unscheduled walk-in.</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller - &quot;Do you accept walk-ins?&quot; // Agent: &quot;We&apos;ll be
            accepting walk-ins all
            day Saturday.&quot; // Caller: &quot;I&apos;ll be there sometime Saturday then!&quot;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller <strong>agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>A walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific
            appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be
            considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon
            arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service
            time
            cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.
          </li>
          <li><br>
          </li>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.&quot; // Agent:
            &quot;We&apos;re
            all booked through the whole week.&quot; // Caller: &quot;Can I just come in and have my car
            serviced
            between other appointments?&quot; // Agent: &quot;You can come in and possibly have your car
            serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a
            few hours.&quot; // Caller: &quot;I&apos;ll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and
            I&apos;ll wait.&quot;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller is having his or her <strong>vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Receptionist or <strong>agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary,</strong> they can just
        show
        up.

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;Can I get my tire rotated today?&quot; // Receptionist or agent:
            &quot;Absolutely. You don&apos;t need an appointment. Just come on in.&quot;// Caller
            acknowledges this
            and the call ends.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The time of the <strong>visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.</strong> <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;My check engine light is on and I&apos;d like to come in to have it
            checked out.&quot; // Agent: &quot;No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after
            12pm&quot;
            // Caller: &quot;Yeah, I&apos;ll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.&quot; // Call ends.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Caller <strong>agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?&quot; // Agent:
            &quot;What time do
            you need it done?&quot; // Caller: &quot;Anytime is fine. I&apos;ll just drop it off at 7:00 and
            leave it there
            for the day.&quot; // Agent: &quot;Great, we&apos;ll get it done before the end of the
            day.&quot;<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>​​<strong>Appointment requested / mentioned but not set</strong>

            Receptionist or
            agent: &quot;We can fit you in tomorrow morning.&quot;// Caller: &quot;That won&apos;t work for
            me. I need to
            get it serviced today.&quot; // Call ends.
          </li>
          <li>Example call - Caller: &quot;I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for
            that?&quot; // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: &quot;Oh, that&apos;s too
            much. I&apos;m
            not interested. Thanks.&quot;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed </strong>
    <ul>
